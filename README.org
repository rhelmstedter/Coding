# Coding

This repository is a collection of coding projects for my middle school coding classes. The 2021-2022 school year will be my second year teaching coding. As I gain more experience coding I plan to piece together various coding projects aimed at beginners. Since my students are all on Chromebooks, all projects will use either [[https://trinket.io][trinket.io]], [[https://replit.com][replit]], or [Google Colabortory (Colab)](https://youtu.be/xoo4mTujM1U).

## Inspiration

I recently stumbled across the excellent [Teaching Python Podcast](https://www.teachingpython.fm/). I highly recommend it.

Dylan Beattie has an amazing talk [The Art of Code](https://youtu.be/6avJHaC3C2U) that speaks to the creative side of coding. I plan to incorporate a bunch of ideas from this talk in my coding class.

## Code Reading Exercises

In her book _The Programmer's Brain_, Felienne Hermans speaks about the importance of reading code. I want to put together a series of code snippets that students can practice reading and determining the output. (Perhaps these can be sorted into categories?)

## Coding Practice

The websites below offer ~~short~~ interesting coding challenges for a range of abilities.

- [Pybites](https://pybit.es/):: Python specific. Great for new coders and really nicely organized. Paid.
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/):: Language Agnostic. Slick interface, but can be difficult to find accessible challenges if students are brand new to coding. Free.
- [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/):: Not specific to coding. This is a capture the flag competition aimed at improving general computer hacking skills. Free
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/):: Language agnostic. Math centric problems designed to be solved with code. Free.
