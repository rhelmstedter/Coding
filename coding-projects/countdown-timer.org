# Countdown Timer

I stumbled across the [[https://www.100daysofcode.com][#100DaysofCode]] challenge. I signed up for the [[https://talkpython.fm/home][Talk Python]] [[https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/100-days-of-code-in-python][#100DaysofCode in Python]] course which is a collaboration between the guys from [[https://twitter.com/pybites][Pybites]] and [[https://twitter.com/mkennedy][Michael Kennedy]]. The first set of lessons focused on the datetime module. In the course, we were supposed to use the datetime module to create a pomodoro timer. Instead, I decided to create a countdown to summer break timer.

I plan to make this one of the first projects for next school year. I might even team up with the makerspace teacher and create an LED sign that displays the countdown. To be real, I'm just trying to make it through this school year.
