# Countdown Timer

I stumbled across the [#100DaysofCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com) challenge. I signed up for the [Talk Python](https://talkpython.fm/home) [#100DaysofCode in Python](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/100-days-of-code-in-python) course which is a collaboration between the guys from [Pybites](https://twitter.com/pybites) and [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy). The first set of lessons focused on the datetime module. In the course, we were supposed to use the datetime module to create a pomodoro timer. Instead, I decided to create a countdown to summer break timer. 

I plan to make this one of the first projects for next school year. I might even team up with the makerspace teacher and create an LED sign that displays the countdown. To be real, I'm just trying to make it through this school year.
