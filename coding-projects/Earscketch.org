# EarSketch
This one is a bit of a challenge. Students can use [EarSketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/) to code their own song in either Python or JavaScript. There are a few tutorials from EarSketch itself, but the interface can be pretty intimidating for beginner coders. I only had a few brave students attempt this one.
