#+date:[2024-08-09 Fri]

The goal is for students to create a game that is centered around their science vocabulary for mission to mars.

There are two options:
1. Create a matching game for vocabulary based on definition.
2. Have students create "hints" for each vocabulary word. They can ask for up to three hints and make a guess.
