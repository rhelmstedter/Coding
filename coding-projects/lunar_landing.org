# ~Lunar~Mars Landing

[Lunar Landing](https://thepythoncodingbook.com/2022/04/24/python-lunar-landing-game-using-turtle-tutorial/) is built by Stephen Gruppetta, This will make a nice addition to the mission to mars project in 6th grade. The math behind making the motion work is pretty advanced, so I settled for having students write only the code before the first function. Students were able to customize their own lander and play with the motion settings without having to code the trig.
