# Machine Learning

First learned about this from [Teaching Python's conversation with Dale Lane](https://www.teachingpython.fm/56). [Dale](https://twitter.com/dalelane) created [Machine Learning 4 Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk). There is a fantastic collection of machine learning projects available in scratch and for use with python.
