#+title: Data Spiral

This is the first project I will start with next year. With the help of the maker space teacher on campus I laser engraved a sign with the source code and a QR code. Students can scan the QR code and start coding on their phones.

This is super accessible ever for students who have zero coding experience.
Code is available on Trinket for anyone to remix.
