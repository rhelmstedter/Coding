#+title: QR Code Generator

Scrolling through my twitter feed and stumbled across [[https://twitter.com/driscollis/status/1501378766018420736?s=20&t=zcUOqTUZNt5emL_QRWjMWw][Mike Driscoll's]] tweet about creating QR codes in python. You can get it done in three lines of code. This will work nicely with the ideas for qr codes Alex has for the makerspace. Now kids have more control over the process and don't have to sign up for a third party QR code generator.
