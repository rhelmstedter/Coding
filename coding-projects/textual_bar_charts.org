# Textual Bar Charts

At the end of episode 75 of the [Teaching Python Podcast](https://www.teachingpython.fm/75), [Sean](https://twitter.com/@smtibor) mentions that he saw someone say they used dictionaries to create these textual bar charts. I have also been seeing a lot about the [rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) module for python written by [Will McGuan](https://twitter.com/willmcgugan). I thought it would be a cool little project to combine these two ideas. 

I created a little script that charts my class sizes by period. The whole script can be written in less than 10 lines of code. Just run `pip install rich` and you should be good to go.
