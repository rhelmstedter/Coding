Conway's game of Life.

This is a simple simulation that can be done in pygame and replit, 
it should be simple to implement rules just make sure students have availability to pygame and it is not blocked on school computers.


P.S. Hi Mr.Helmsteder I did this in replit as my AP CS P College board final it's [here](https://replit.com/join/jiuezjyrds-williampalmisa1)
P.s. I also uploaded a file to do this in pygame.
