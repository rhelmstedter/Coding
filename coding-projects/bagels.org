#+title: Bagels

Don't let the name fool you (as it did me), this is awesome. [[https://www.armoredpenguin.com/bagels/][Bagels]] is a logic game originally played with paper and pencil. This is from Al Sweigart's [[https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/][Big Book of Small Python Projects]]. I modified the code so that it uses snake case instead of camel case and is formatted with f-strings. I also added a function for validating the user's guess. I plan to give students a template that includes the directions for the game to avoid making them type everything. It will also serve as an outline for the program.
