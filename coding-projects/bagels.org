Don't let the name fool you (as it did me), this is awesome. [[https://www.armoredpenguin.com/bagels/][Bagels]] is a logic game originally played with paper and pencil. This is from Al Sweigart's [[https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/][Big Book of Small Python Projects]]. I modified the code so that it uses snake case instead of camel case and is formatted with f-strings. I also added a function for validating the user's guess. I plan to give students a template that includes the directions for the game to avoid making them type everything. It will also serve as an outline for the program.

I am thinking of a {NUM_DIGITS}-digit number with no repeated digits.
Try to guess what it is. I will give you clues about your guess:
When I say:    That means:
  Pico           One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
  Fermi          One digit is correct and in the right position.
  Bagels         No digit is correct.

For example, if the secret number was 248 and your guess was 843, the
clues would be Fermi Pico.\n"""
